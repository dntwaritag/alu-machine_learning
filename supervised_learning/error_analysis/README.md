# Error Analysis Project

## Project Overview

Project Overview
This project explores error analysis in classification models by leveraging a confusion matrix. The confusion matrix serves as a diagnostic tool to evaluate model performance by categorizing predictions into true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives. By analyzing these metrics, we can pinpoint areas where the model struggles and make informed improvements.

Objectives
Construct and visualize a confusion matrix for a given classification model.
Identify misclassification patterns and their impact on model performance.
Calculate key evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Interpret results to fine-tune the model and minimize errors.
